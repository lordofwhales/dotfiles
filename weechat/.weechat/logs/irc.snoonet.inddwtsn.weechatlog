2015-07-14 23:19:36	inddwtsn	the basic scripts to download are buffers, highmon, iset, check em
2015-07-14 23:19:50	inddwtsn	chek em is a suggestion, not a script, lol
2015-07-14 23:21:05	DukeCeph	haha
2015-07-14 23:21:07	DukeCeph	sure thing
2015-07-14 23:21:27	DukeCeph	decorations: @-hats, +s, etc
2015-07-14 23:21:50	inddwtsn	mm, haven't checked, hang on
2015-07-14 23:22:08	DukeCeph	ooh, i like that it does lines for last-seen-message automatically
2015-07-14 23:23:28	inddwtsn	ill ask in #weechat, i think those things have a name other than decorations but I can't recall
2015-07-14 23:23:49	DukeCeph	yeah, not sure
2015-07-14 23:38:03	inddwtsn	weird
2015-07-14 23:38:30	inddwtsn	i cant find a way to move it to the right but you can change the decoration colors if you want them to stand out
2015-07-14 23:40:06	inddwtsn	 /set irc.colors.nick_prefixes red
2015-07-14 23:42:32	inddwtsn	http://i.imgur.com/tFb2PvL.png my setup atm
2015-07-14 23:44:44	DukeCeph	grump grump
2015-07-14 23:45:00	DukeCeph	irc.colors.nick_prefixes already has a sensible colored default
2015-07-14 23:45:19	DukeCeph	and irc.look.item_nick_prefix is on
2015-07-14 23:45:22	DukeCeph	but they're not coloring
2015-07-14 23:45:31	DukeCeph	meh, they stand out against colored names well enough i guess
2015-07-14 23:46:10	DukeCeph	shiny setup tho
2015-07-14 23:46:16	inddwtsn	oh it must be another option
2015-07-14 23:46:19	DukeCeph	oh, one just colored!
2015-07-14 23:46:24	DukeCeph	i have no idea
2015-07-14 23:46:32	DukeCeph	maybe it's better now?
2015-07-14 23:46:42	inddwtsn	oh wait
2015-07-14 23:46:46	inddwtsn	did you install iset?
2015-07-14 23:46:51	DukeCeph	yeah
2015-07-14 23:46:56	inddwtsn	do /iset
2015-07-14 23:47:06	DukeCeph	very options wow
2015-07-14 23:47:12	inddwtsn	and in that buffer type prefixes, and that option should show up
2015-07-14 23:47:19	inddwtsn	and if you press alt enter you can change the value
2015-07-14 23:47:29	inddwtsn	and on the top it explains you can color each mode individually
2015-07-14 23:47:36	DukeCeph	yeah, that makes sense
2015-07-14 23:47:44	DukeCeph	it's set to a sensible thing
2015-07-14 23:47:51	DukeCeph	it appears athats have color now
2015-07-14 23:48:00	DukeCeph	it took a while to take or something iunno
2015-07-14 23:48:31	inddwtsn	you can do /upgrade to refresh 
2015-07-14 23:48:49	DukeCeph	ooh
2015-07-14 23:48:53	DukeCeph	nifty
2015-07-14 23:48:55	DukeCeph	i like it
2015-07-14 23:50:06	inddwtsn	lol i set the @ to red to see if it changed and now it looks horrible
