2015-07-14 23:19:53	@Solfire	For some reason I like doing them better than squats or even bulgarian squats
2015-07-14 23:19:55	DukeCeph	shul0k: if you want hard sci-fi, go for Vorpal Blade. Straight military, Kildar. Fantasy-sci-fi, There Will Be Dragons. The first and last are probs my favorites
2015-07-14 23:20:01	shul0k	Oberon: maybe it was someone else at the same time as you were talking. My memory attributed it to you
2015-07-14 23:20:02	@Solfire	There's something super convenient feeling about them
2015-07-14 23:20:03	@emnullzweiundneunzig	it's because you're a sissy
2015-07-14 23:20:12	DukeCeph	Solfire: haha, sissy squats?

2015-07-14 23:21:07	@emnullzweiundneunzig	he had mad quads
2015-07-14 23:21:14	@emnullzweiundneunzig	so he got a squat named after him
2015-07-14 23:21:16	inddwtsn	DukeCeph: decorations?

2015-07-14 23:22:07	@emnullzweiundneunzig	uh
2015-07-14 23:22:11	@Solfire	More or less the same as doing air squats
2015-07-14 23:22:12	@emnullzweiundneunzig	I have it as sisyphus
2015-07-14 23:22:30	@emnullzweiundneunzig	I'm pretty sure that's right

2015-07-14 23:23:42	@Solfire	And I enjoy doing them way more
2015-07-14 23:23:50	@Solfire	I honestly think if I had some kind of tall plyobox or something
2015-07-14 23:23:58	@Solfire	I'd be doing a lot of deep steps
2015-07-14 23:24:00	@Solfire	Or whatever they're called
2015-07-14 23:24:04	@Solfire	Deep step ups

2015-07-14 23:25:00	@emnullzweiundneunzig	you could find a couple of sturdy men to stand on
2015-07-14 23:25:10	shul0k	And moving equipment is a bitch
2015-07-14 23:25:30	@emnullzweiundneunzig	is instagram against nsfw stuff?
2015-07-14 23:25:44	@Solfire	Somewhat
