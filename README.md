dotfiles
========

Robert's assorted dotfiles

To use these, simply go to your home directory and run:

    git clone http://github.com/rperce/dotfiles .dotfiles
    cd .dotfiles
    chmod +x link
    ./link

Existing dotfiles of the same name will be moved to $filename.old.  If such a file exists, probably horrible things will happen.  There is not yet any update functionality without manually removing the old dotfiles.
